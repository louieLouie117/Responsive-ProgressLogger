                <h2>Why is coding more important
                    now than ever before?</h2>
                <p>We are currently in a pre-paradigm shift on the types of work available in the future, and the year
                    2020 sure has sped up this paradigm shift.</p>
                <p>Getting started with coding is crucial, and from my experience, the best way to learn to code is to
                    start coding websites then web apps. The reason is that websites and web apps are the fastest way to
                    have a finished product.</p>

            <h2>Getting started with websites.</h2>
            <p>
                The best place to start learning to code is websites because what you learn can be applied to web apps.
                I will discuss three things you must do to code websites. I will also mention three personal
                recommendations I wished someone told me when starting to code. Let us begin with the the things you
                must do. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>1. Download two free software</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>2. Learn three coding languages</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>3. Understand the fundamental of programming</p>
                </li>

            </ul>
            <section id="FreeSoftware">
                <h2 onclick="GetStartedSectionHandler(event)">About the free softwares</h2>
                <p>The two free software your going to need are Adobe XD and Visual Studio Code.</p>
                <section>
                    <h3>Adobe XD</h3>
                    <img src="assets/adobeXdImg.png" alt="">
                    <p>Adobe XD is software you use to create mockups. You will be using it to draw a website or app
                        digitally. It is used for UX/UI design to bring your ideas into a concept. You can download it
                        for
                        free on the adobes website.</p>

                    <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
                    <img src="assets/vsCodeImg.png" alt="">
                    <p>Visual Studio Code is a code editor that you use to type your code. There are plenty of code
                        editors
                        you can use, and in my opinion, Visual Studio Code is the king of them all. There are many
                        reasons
                        to use Visual Studio Code over other editors, and the number one reason is that it is free.
                        Don't
                        waste your time reaching what code editor to use, download VS code, and spend your time coding.

            <section id="CodingLanguages">
                <h2 onclick="GetStartedSectionHandler(event)">The three coding languages</h2>
                <p>The three coding languages that you need to learn are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When I first
                    started, I read many articles that said to start with HTML. However, I am here to tell you that it
                    is possible to learn both HTML and CSS together, and the best way to learn to have your hands on the
                    keyboard and start typing HTML and CSS.</p>
                <img src="assets/fundamentalsImg.png" alt="">
                <section>
                    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                    <p>At its core, HTML outlines all the content a person sees when they visit a website. It is a
                        markup code that you type so that a computer can interpret and display the content. To get
                        started with HTML, you will need to use HTML elements. Elements give the website structure and
                        meaning.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                    <p>CSS is a markup language code that you type to create styles for HTML elements. When you use CSS,
                        you will be selecting specific elements and modifying them. Selecting and modifying elements is
                        the reason why CSS exists.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript is a programming langue that gives a list of instructions to be executed by a
                        computer. The list of instructions is known as statements. JavaScript is an intermediate langue
                        that you want to study in-depth. However, you don't have to wait till you fully understand
                        JavaScript to start using it. You can begin using some of the basics by understanding the
                        fundamental concepts.</p>

            <section id="ProgrammingFundamentals">
                <h2 onclick="GetStartedSectionHandler(event)">Programming Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>In regards to programming fundaments, I have listed the seven concepts you need to understand. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>1. Variables</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>2. Data Types</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>3. Arrays</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>4. Functions</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>5. Loops</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>6. Conditions</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>7. Objects</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are new to programming, you need to spend time reading about the fundaments. I have included
                    in the materials and books section an excellent book you can start reading.</p>
                <p>Now, make sure you read
                    this for fun and don't spend a lot of time taking notes and rereading things you might have a hard
                    time understanding because, with programming, the best way to learn is by physically typing out the
                    code. If you have any questions about the fundaments or need help getting started typing the code, I
                    will have a way to contact me at the end of this article.</p>

            <h2>Personal Recommendations.</h2>
            <p>Regarding my personal recommendation, I would have loved it if someone had shared these three
                recommendations with me early on my programming journey. </p>
            <ul>

                <li>
                    <p>1. Learn how to learn</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>2. Have a daily journal</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>3. Connect with others</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <section id="LearnHowToLearnSection">
                <h2 onclick="GetStartedSectionHandler(event)">Learn how to learn</h2>
                <p>My first personal recommendation is something you need to do before you start learning to code. Which
                    is, you need to learn how to learn. Knowing how to learn is a powerful tool that will help you
                    master programming. </p>
                <p>
                    Before discovering <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn"> Learning How to
                        Learn</a>, a free online course on Coursera by Barbara Oakley and Dr.
                    Terrence Sejnowski, I found programming difficult, not because coding was difficult to learn but
                    rather because I lacked the skills how to learn to code. Although this is a recommendation, I go
                    over this course, especially the part dealing with procrastination and memory techniques.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="HaveDailyJournalSection">
                <h2 onclick="GetStartedSectionHandler(event)">Have a daily journal</h2>
                <p>I would say that I have become more productive since I started keeping a daily journal of all my
                    successes and failures. Writing your daily thoughts has many benefits, and I have included a book
                    that discusses this topic in the material and books section.
                </p>
                <p>Once I read all the benefits, I know that this was something I need to do daily. Since I started to
                    keep a daily log, I experience that the things I wrote down I would be able to recall
                    subconsciously.
                </p>
                <p>This is why I prioritized developing the daily journal first for this web app. I personally carate a
                    section every month and try to write every morning and before going to sleep. If you haven't
                    already, take the time to create a new section and write your first entry log.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="ConnectWithOthersSection">
                <h2 onclick="GetStartedSectionHandler(event)">Connect with others</h2>
                <p>This last recommendation is something I would have loved when I first started coding. However,
                    growing up, there were no programmers I could connect with for mentorship, and to this day, many
                    people face this same problem.
                </p>
                <p>That is why my mission for this web app is to connect anyone interested in programming with mentors
                    who want to help. I will be developing the social network aspect for this web app in the upcoming
                    versions. </p>

            </section>
            <p>If you have any questions on any of the six topics, don't hesitate to connect with me. If you already
                know you want to start coding, you can read more about my beginners, intermediate, and advanced

            <h2>Getting Started with web apps.</h2>
            <p>Once you have done 3-4 websites, you can move on to web apps. Web apps are complex, and I break down the
                complexity in the advice mentorship. If you already have prior knowledge of creating a website with
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and are looking to get started with web apps, you can connect with me for any
